# Soft Block - A Better Discord Plugin

Soft block people on Discord (remove their messages instantly without blocking them via the client).

Features:
* Select one or more people to soft block and their messages will be hidden. It currently works on a 500ms configurable timer so you may see them for a split second but you usually should not.
* Optionally hide them in the userlist
* Optionally select to still be able to see their DMs and only hide their server chat

Coming soon:
* Ability to whitelist certain servers/channels so they are hidden everywhere but there
* Right click menu to add/remove people to the list

You can report bugs or ask for new features by using the Issues page.
